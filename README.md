For my second assignment I decided to make a tower defense game. 

When the program is run it first displays a menu. From this menu the user can click to start the game. 
Once the game has been started the user is in a setup phase. During this phase towers can be placed. 
For the first round only the first tower is available. This tower costs $50 and does 2 damage per hit to the enemy. 
When the player hits start, the creeps begin making their way from the start of the map to the end. 
Once all enemies have either made it through the map or been killed, the game goes back into the setup phase 
where the player can place more towers including the second type of tower. The second round contains
more enemies and half of these are a stronger, slower variety of enemy. The game continues for five rounds or until the
player loses. A player can get a game over if half of the enemies of any given round get through the map. There are five 
different towers, each one costing more than the last and doing more damage than the last. Each round unlocks another 
tower. Towers are selected by clicking on their icon at the bottom of the screen. Towers are then placed by clicking
on the space of the map where you wish to place it. If a tower has already been placed in a space, no other tower can be 
placed there.
